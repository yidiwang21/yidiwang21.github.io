## About Me
I will join the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/) at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in Sept 2024. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Riverside in 2023.  
During my time at UCR, I have several publications in premier conference in the field of real-time systems, with focus on real-time scheduling for GPU-accelerated applications. My primary research interests are in the field of real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems. 

## Research Interests
<span style="color:red">My core objective is to advance the design of responsive, predictable, and verifiable computing systems for tasks with dynamic timing constraints especially in resource limited environments.</span>

For my research style, it spans from system implementation, including developing novel scheduling algorithms in practical systems across the whole software stack, to theoretical analysis including formulating mathematical models for system analysis.

So far, my research has mainly focused on addressing the challenges of integrating GPUs in real-time scheduling where tasks have stringent timing requirements. They covers several aspects: (i) non-deterministic GPU behaviors, (ii) underutilized computing resources, (iii) scheduling for tasks having varied arrival patterns with constrained deadlines, and (iv) power management in GPU platforms [[Preprint24a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16529), [RTSS22](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2022/RTSS22_sBEET-mg.pdf), [RTSS22@Work](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2022/RTSSWork22_paper.pdf), [RTSS21](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2021/RTSS21_sBEET.pdf), [RTSS19-Wip](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2019/rtss19wip-gpu)].

Besides, I also work on ensuring the reliable system operation on intermittently-powered batteryless devices [[Preprint24b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07227), [RTCSA22](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2022/RTCSA22_AoI.pdf), [IoTJ21](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2021/iotj2021-ipd.pdf)], and reliable system support for intelligent applications [[RTSS21b](https://yidiwang21.github.io/files/2021/RTSS21_AegisDNN.pdf)].

Built upon these, currently my research interests include:
* Efficient scheduling for LLMs on edge devices
* Enabling ML for decision-making in operating systems
* Real-time scheduling for heterogeneous platforms

## To Work With Me
<span style="color:red">I am looking for a PhD student highly interested in systems research, starting at Fall 2025.</span> Please be prepared to commit 4-5 years of hard work in research, and rewards may take time in this field. If you are still interested in this field, please drop me an email with title <u>"Prospective PhD Student - Fall 2025 - Your first name"</u>, and attach your CV, transcripts, and a writing sample (e.g. publication, thesis, report) if available.  
Master's, undergraduate students and summer interns are also welcome. To apply, please drop me an email with with title <u>"Prospective MS/UG/summer intern Student - Your first name"</u> including your CV and transcripts.

**Feel free to reach out to me for research discussions or potential collaborations—I am always open to new ideas and partnerships!**
