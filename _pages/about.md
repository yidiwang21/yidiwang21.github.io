## About Me
I will join the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/) at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in Sept 2024. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Riverside in 2023.  
During my time at UCR, I have several publications in premier conference in the field of real-time systems, with focus on real-time scheduling for GPU-accelerated applications. My primary research interests are in the field of real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems. 

## Research Interests
<span style="color:red">My core objective is to advance the design of responsive, predictable, and verifiable computing systems for tasks with dynamic timing constraints especially in resource limited environments.</span>

For my research style, it spans from system implementation, including developing novel scheduling algorithms in practical systems across the whole software stack, to theoretical analysis including formulating mathematical models for system analysis.

So far, my research has mainly focused on addressing the challenges of integrating GPUs in real-time scheduling where tasks have stringent timing requirements. They covers several aspects: (i) non-deterministic GPU behaviors, (ii) underutilized computing resources, (iii) scheduling for tasks having varied arrival patterns with constrained deadlines, and (iv) power management in GPU platforms [[ECRTS24](../files/2024/ecrts24_gcaps_paper.pdf), [Preprint24a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16529), [RTSS22](../files/2022/RTSS22_sBEET-mg.pdf), [RTSS22@Work](../files/2022/RTSSWork22_paper.pdf), [RTSS21](../files/2021/RTSS21_sBEET.pdf), [RTSS19-Wip](../files/2019/rtss19wip-gpu)].

Besides, I also work on ensuring the reliable system operation on intermittently-powered batteryless devices [[Preprint24b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07227), [RTCSA22](../files/2022/RTCSA22_AoI.pdf), [IoTJ21](../files/2021/iotj2021-ipd.pdf)], and reliable system support for intelligent applications [[RTSS21b](../files/2021/RTSS21_AegisDNN.pdf)].

Built upon these, currently my research interests include:
* Efficient scheduling for LLMs on edge devices
* Enabling ML for decision-making in operating systems
* Real-time scheduling for heterogeneous platforms

**Feel free to reach out to me for research discussions or potential collaborations â€” I am always open to new ideas and partnerships!**

## Prospective Students
<span style="color:red">I am looking for a PhD student highly interested in systems research, starting at Fall 2025, and I am also looking for multiple Master's, undergraduate students to work with me.</span> If you are interested, please drop me an email with title <u>"Prospective PhD/MS/UG Student - Your name"</u>, and attach your CV and transcripts.


## News
- May 2024: One paper will appear at [ECRTS 2024](https://www.ecrts.org/). This work provides a solution with minimal userspace code modification to enable GPU preemption, and it is also the first one to provide a response time analysis for the default GPU scheduling approach. Check it out: [[ECRTS24](../files/2024/ecrts24_gcaps_paper.pdf)].
- Mar 2024: I will be joining Santa Clara University as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in CSE starting in Fall 2024!
- Feb 2024: I am serving on the TPC for [RTAS@BP 2024](https://2024.rtas.org/call-for-papers-the-brief-presentations-track/).
- Aug 2023: Started to work as a Postdoc at UCR.
- Jun 2023: I completed all requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the field of Electrical Engineering at UCR.
