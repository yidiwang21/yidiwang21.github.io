## About Me
I am an an Assistant Professor in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/) at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Riverside in 2023.  
During my time at UCR, I have several publications in premier conference in the field of real-time systems, with focus on real-time scheduling for GPU-accelerated applications. My primary research interests are in the field of real-time embedded and cyber-physical systems. 

Feel free to reach out to me for research discussions or potential collaborations — I am always open to new ideas and partnerships!

## Prospective Students
